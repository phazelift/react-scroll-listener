react-scroll-listener (+ Mixin)
========

<br/>

A window scroll-event listener class for use in React apps. The default handler uses a timeout for smooth scrolling. Add and remove multiple handlers on the same timeout/instance for efficiency. Extend it with a flux store, or use as mixin.


under development, it works, still testing..
